# OpenFN 
## Planning and Brainfarts on What I'd Like An Open Source FNBR Clone To Look Like
### Goal:
To create an open source implementation of Fortnite Battle Royale.  People would be able to host their own servers to play on,
where they would be in control of everything from how the game looks, feels, the physics, weapon pool, et cetera.  This would 
allow them to mimic any chapter that has existed, or will exist, in the core FortniteBR game, or even create variations of the
game mode that have never been seen before.  Server operators would be able to have the ability to utilize active moderation in 
the form of people, AND/OR plugins/moderation tools to make running servers easier with regards to player conduct.
