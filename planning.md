# OpenFN 
## Planning and Brainfarts on What I'd Like An Open Source FNBR Clone To Look Like
### Goal:
To create an open source implementation of Fortnite Battle Royale.  Users and server operators would be able to host their own games, 
and have full control over the feel, physics, and mechanics of the game, being able to mimic any format of the core Battle Royale game,
and even create variations that had never been seen before.
